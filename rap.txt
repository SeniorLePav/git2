It's a cold, cold world outside
I ain't got no one that I can trust 
I got my guard up so high 
I can't even be with you

Tell me bae now can we please stop fightin', I need you on side me
I might lose my life tonight
Later on, I'm gon' be Maybach ridin', World War III inside me
Tryna see why nothin' I do ain't right (okay, okay)
He don't give a fuck bout nobody but himself, oh
He wanna get one down, don't care if I left, oh 
Know he got shit poppin' but at home he got shit goin' on
Leave that shit alone let me lean, pass me my Styrofoam
Don't conversate about me with your friends
Confiscatin' bring back backends
Love me right and bring back my mind
And don't never leave like ones back then
Shine right and have fun with your girls
I just wanna see you set some trends
They don't love me like way back then
Wasn't even there for me even most my mans
I just wanna ballout fall off in my big home
All these drugs that I'm on from depression got me on
P.O. threaten me one on one, just wanna be left alone
They tryna say Top wrong, they tryna say Top wrong
Smilin' been ridin' 'round all day I'm loaded and I'm tryna fuck you in the coupe
Next time I flood you with diamonds I'm goin' extravagant, do your wrist too
Panic, I buy you a Patek you better go tat' it just like Nene too
Flood my kids with diamonds like I do my crew

Oh, tell me now
Is you tryna break me or you tryna make me
Somethin' better off

For shit that I painted, the shit that they see
For shit that I live and the things that I breathe
They don't want me to succeed, I still ain't make it out
I see it all in my dreams (of me bangin' out)
Wrist rock
All these niggas, they done flip-flopped
Catch me out on scene with a big Glock
Know that I might leave out here, but I been stayin' up
Hopin' all my pain I spilled starts one day payin' off
Hope my daddy get that appeal and they let my mans out
We got a drop now, okay load up, let's ride out
I can't take a risk without my stick, was just my sign now
That's what the fuck I'm talkin' 'bout, can't take a risk all by myself at all
Better not get yourself involved

It's a cold, cold world outside
I ain't got no one that I can trust 
I got my guard up so high 
I can't even be with you

Oh, tell me now
Is you tryna break me or you tryna make me
Somethin' better off

Oh, tell me now
Is you tryna break me or you tryna make me
Somethin' better off
